        <h2 class="iron-chariots">IRON CHARIOTS</h2>
        <p id="chariots-detail">
            First of all, it is important to understand that a Chariot is not just something that is pulled by horses. Rather, the part on which the riders are present is called CHARIOT. It is also called a car or carriage etc. But since we have been seeing Chariot horsemen since the beginning, most of us consider Chariot horse carriage.
                        It is a subject that has many theories about how they were chariots. According to some, they were ordinary chariots that were made of wood, with horses pulling them in front of them, and iron rails were placed on top of this wood. But from a particular point of view, this theory is not only weak, but at once "empty".
                        Because Judah's being helpless in front of these chariots and then God himself overturning them proves that their formation and construction was of a very special type. Due to which its riders will also be safe. And it won't be horse-drawn at all. Otherwise, hit the horses and that's it.
                        You can see this type of chariot in the picture. While the rest of the images are the original Assyrian technology that was originally used in these areas.
                        So, before knowing more about this subject, we first take a look at this region and the conditions at that time, whether who lived in these regions at that time. What were their fighting skills (weapons)?
                        First, a historical look at the area.
                        When the Israelites followed Joshua into this country and fought, there were different countries, nations, kingdoms, and governments at that time.
                        One of them is the ASSYRIAN government, also called "Assyrians" in Urdu, who were the people of "Mesopotamia". They are very important.
                        The Assyrian people were living in these areas and were also ruling in many areas. They had mostly plains. There were also hills but in the plains their number of fighting men was greater because they had special war equipments, especially "iron chariots" which were very difficult to carry on high altitudes (mountains). It used to be. Apart from this, they used to supply military supplies and weapons. And such chariots were impossible for horses to pull and that too during the war. Because if the horses die, their movement and movement is impossible. That's why the system of driving it was completely different from ordinary chariots.
                        Among them, the valley of Iskelon was one of the 5 big and great cities of Canaan. And then Ekron and its suburbs, especially under the Assyrians, became more developed in the 12th CE, with more than 100 olive-grinding factories.
                        When the Assyrians occupied them, the Assyrians had modern weapons which the rest of the countries did not have. "Iron Chariots" are very important among them.
                        These iron chariots were originally invented by the Assyrians.
                        Now let's look at their structure.
                        As mentioned earlier, according to some, these were ordinary wooden chariots with wrought iron and drawn by horses. And 2-4 riders used to come on it.
                        But the problem in this is that if they cannot protect their rider from above, from the sides and from behind, then iron is of no use on these chariots. Because the Canaanites and various other peoples, including the Assyrians, were in the valley and Judah was on the hills, they could easily be attacked from above, from the sides, and from the rear, and all of them could be killed. But it didn't happen. Rather, Judah's army failed. Which also shows that the people who fought many wars in the presence of Moses and who were famous warriors whose fear was spreading in every region were not familiar with this new machinery/war weapon. Nor did they know how to destroy it.
                        Now coming to the details of this new machinery/war weapon for Judah.
                        A city in Iraq called "Mosul" which is also known as "Ninewah". In one of its ancient palaces, which was later turned into a museum, on a wall on its north-west side, detailed engravings of this "Iron Chariot" and the situations of their various wars can also be seen. Which was shifted from there to "British Museum London". (A lot of such historic things have been destroyed by ISIS there, including the palace)
                        Their regular details are seen on them, according to which they were completely covered with iron from the top and sides and from the back.
                         According to some, they were open from the back and top, and according to some, they were closed from all sides, but by looking at the patterns on the stones, it can be well guessed that they were closed from all sides.
                        They also used to deliver water and weapons and soldiers.
                        It was run without animals. It is strongly believed that these batteries were operated (as evidenced by the discovery of the Baghdadi battery).
                        Or some soldiers in it specially used to drive it by paddling. These climbs were also climbed but on straight paths. It was very difficult to use it on unconnected roads on the hill.
                        There was a special long iron pole in front of it, which was used to break the big protective walls around cities and villages in wars. Above it was a large room with many windows in which the archers were standing. These archers were completely safe from external arrows. But they had the ability to attack the enemy without risk.
                        After that, it had two portions. On the upper one there were soldiers and weapons and water pots. So that if this "iron chariot" is set on fire, water can be used. And the bottom floor was for every soldier who was "paddling" or whatever (battery system) to work. And with the rest of the weapons or grain etc. Because whatever was supplied in it was all on the bottom floor. In this, the length of one unit was estimated to be 5 meters and the height was 2-3 meters and the minaret for archers was about 3 meters. It was a very good chariot. which would have been impossible to attack. And since it was made of iron only, and of thick iron, it weighed considerably more, and so did all the military equipment and its own systems combined. That it was impossible for humans to reverse it.
                        It also had smaller sizes which were used on a smaller scale. It means there were 2 to 3 different sizes in it.
                         In this entire region, Jerusalem and Lachish were two cities that were free from Assyrian rule, but Lachish was attacked by the Assyrians, whose details are depicted on the wall of this palace with these iron chariots.
                        Now, since this iron chariot was almost closed from all sides and its riders were protected from all sides, it was impossible to conquer it. And of course, the army of Judah did not win over him, and then the next day God himself destroyed him.
                        So the research and battle conditions and stone drawings show that the Assyrians in this period were intelligent people in modern weapons and war tactics. And the iron chariot that Judah could not conquer was actually the same Assyrian "iron chariot".
